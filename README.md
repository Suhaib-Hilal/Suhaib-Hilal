### Hello, I'm Suhaib! 👋

- I'm a high school student with a passion for coding and a focus on Python development.
- I also dabble in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Dart. I don't have very much of an experience in them, so I am current trying to gain experience in them as well by making huge projects.
- I enjoy the thrill of exploring new ideas and crafting innovative projects. When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in my favorite TV shows.

### Let's Dive into My World:

- 👨‍💻 All my coding adventures are waiting for you at [My GitHub](https://github.com/Suhaib-Hilal).
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at **tantary.suhaib.main@gmail.com**.
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I might be a kid, but I'm already making a mark in the tech world!
